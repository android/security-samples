Android Security Samples Repository
===================================

This repository contains a set of individual Android Studio projects to help you get
started writing/understanding Android security features.

## [Android BiometricLogin Sample](https://github.com/android/security-samples/tree/master/BiometricLoginKotlin)

This is the canonical sample that demonstrates how to integrate Android Biometrics into your apps.
Whether your project is for government, healthcare, financial, enterprise, or general usage, this
sample should guide your implementation.

## [Android DirectBoot Sample](https://github.com/android/security-samples/tree/master/DirectBoot)

This sample demonstrates how to store and access data in a device protected
storage that is always available while the device is booted.

## [Android FIDO2 API Sample](https://github.com/android/security-samples/tree/master/Fido)

A sample app showing how to register and authenticate with Public Key
Credentials using the FIDO2 API. 

FIDO2 API is used for devices running Android N (API level 24) or newer.

## [File Locker Sample](https://github.com/android/security-samples/tree/master/FileLocker)

A sample that demonstrates how to use the Jetpack Security library to encrypt and decrypt files by
implementing a simple note taking app.

## Android Key Attestation Sample

For a tool that illustrates how to use the Bouncy Castle ASN.1 parser to extract information from an Android attestation data structure to verify that a key pair has been generated in an Android device, check out this [repository](https://github.com/google/android-key-attestation).
