A sample that demonstrates to use registered fingerprints to authenticate the user in your app

Introduction
------------

This sample demonstrates how you can use registered fingerprints in your app to authenticate the
user before proceeding some actions such as purchasing an item.

First you need to create a symmetric key in the Android Key Store using [KeyGenerator][1]
which can be only be used after the user has authenticated with fingerprint and pass
a [KeyGenParameterSpec][2].

By setting [KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder.setUserAuthenticationRequired][3] to true, you can permit
the use of the key only after the user authenticate it including when authenticated with the user's
fingerprint.

Then start listening to a fingerprint on the fingerprint sensor by calling
[FingerprintManager.authenticate][4] with a [Cipher][5] initialized with the symmetric key created.
Or alternatively you can fall back to server-side verified password as an authenticator.

Once the fingerprint (or password) is verified, the
[FingerprintManager.AuthenticationCallback#onAuthenticationSucceeded()][6] callback is called.
